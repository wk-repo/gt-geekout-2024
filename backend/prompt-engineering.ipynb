        "The recommended way of launching the microservice is via Docker. Docker allows you to spin up [containers](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container/) (you can think of them as applications running in a virtual machine) without having to worry about the dependencies (e.g. installing NodeJS, Python etc directly into your computer environment).\n",

        "### Running the microservice directly on your machine\n",
        "- You will need to install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) on your machine.\n",
        "- Run `npm install` in the directory of `/backend` to install the required dependencies.\n",
        "- You may need Python 3, and then run `pip install openai==0.27.9` to install the python openai module.\n",

In `generateContent`, you are given the option to configure how you want to call OpenAI; if you are more familiar with NodeJS, you can change `generateContent` to call the `chatCompletion` function.

This can be done using a separate query to the LLM, or via existing [keyphrase extraction models](https://huggingface.co/models?other=keyphrase-extraction)\n",
        "  - You can convert the query into a embedding whic can then be against a database of embeddings to identify the most relevant documents. [Example](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/examples/Question_answering_using_embeddings.ipynb)\n",

A possible approach is then to use LLMs to classify incoming queries, and then [\"route\"](https://betterprogramming.pub/unifying-llm-powered-qa-techniques-with-routing-abstractions-438e2499a0d0) the queries to the most appropriate system. [Langchain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/chains/foundational/router) gives a simplified example on this by routing incoming queries to the most relevant domain-specific prompts.\n",

        "  - It can also be used to generate functional code. This allows the AI to either use machine code to improve the correctness of its results, or perform tasks beyond generating text, especially if you give the AI an environment (preferrably isolated) to run the code it generates.\n",
        "  - An example of this in action is described in this [article](https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-moment-i-realized-chatgpt-plus-was-a-game-changer-for-my-business/) which describe how the author used ChatGPT Plus to process a CSV document using techniques based on this idea. The idea shown here is instead of feeding the user information (context) into the system prompt, the information is stored in the file and ChatGPT only writes code (presumably python) to interact with the file. The code is then executed to produce the appropriate responses.\n",
